# OpenLume

OpenLume is an initiative to create an open-source version inspired by the Resolume software, widely used for video manipulation and live visual performances. This project aims to democratize access to high-quality tools for VJs, visual artists, and creators in general.

## Current Status

At the moment, OpenLume is just an idea in its initial phase. I am dedicating time to study the tools, technologies, and frameworks needed to turn this concept into reality. This research phase is crucial to ensure the project is viable and well-structured.

## Objectives

- Create a powerful and flexible platform for visual performances.
- Provide an open-source alternative to Resolume.
- Encourage community collaboration to enrich the project with new ideas and features.

## Future Contributions

Although the project is not yet in active development, I plan to share more information as the research phase progresses. All future contributions are welcome, from initial discussions about architecture to the development of specific features.

## License

OpenLume will be released under an open-source license (to be defined) to ensure freedom of use, modification, and distribution.
